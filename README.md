# Introduction to Deep Learning

## Abstract
The study of the discipline "Modern Methods of Machine Learning" aims at mastering advanced methods and algorithms of machine learning using the Python programming language. The course is the third in the minor "Data Intelligence Analysis". It is expected that as a result of mastering the course, students will be able to independently select machine learning methods to solve complex data analysis tasks.
